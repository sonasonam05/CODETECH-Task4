##  Project Overview

This project is a **Run-Length Encoding (RLE) based compression and decompression tool** implemented in C. It allows users to compress and decompress text files by reducing sequences of repeated characters. It also compares the original and compressed file sizes and only keeps the compressed file if it's effective.
